## Post-Synthesis GLS  
## Purpose of GLS

The Gate-Level Simulation (GLS) verifies the correctness of a synthesized netlist by ensuring it behaves exactly like the original RTL design.

When a circuit is synthesized, its Verilog code is converted into a gate-level representation (composed of standard cells like AND, OR, flip-flops, etc.).
GLS helps confirm that this transformation did not change the intended behavior.
